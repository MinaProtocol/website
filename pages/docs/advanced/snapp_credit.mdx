### Ubuntu 20.04

Download the Ubuntu 20.04 version [here](""). Once downloaded, you can install by issuing the following:

```
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ~/Downloads/snapp-credit-check-ubuntu20.04.deb
```

### Ubuntu 18.04

Download the Ubuntu 18.04 version [here](""). Once downloaded, you can install by issuing the following:

```
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ~/Downloads/snapp-credit-check-ubuntu18.04.deb
```

### macOS

Download the macOS version [here](""). Before installing on your Mac, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```
brew install jemalloc gmp libsodium openssl@1.1
```

### WSL2

It is possible to get the app running WSL2 but you will need to set up X11 forwarding to see app running on your local machine. If you already have X11 forwarding set up on your Windows
machine, you can use the [Ubuntu 20.04 version]("") to get started:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y /path/to/snapp-credit-check-ubuntu20.04.deb
```

## Usage

To get started using the Mina SNAPP Credit app, you will need an existing Credit Karma account. We currently support both the USA and Canadian versions of the website.

Let's create a SNARK proof to prove we have a credit score above 700 according to Credit Karma.

1. Start by opening up the Mina app and entering your ETH public key, your credit karma credentials, output directory, and specified domain of credit karma.

2. Press `Generate SNAPP Proof`

3. Wait for the Mina app to verify your Credit Karma credentials

/>

4. Once your credentials pass, creating a SNAPP proof is started. This process can take a bit of time as computing a SNARK is a computationally intensive task. Creating a SNARK can take
   between 30 seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware.

If everything goes well, then it's a success! We have generated a SNARK proof that proves we have a Credit Karma account that has a credit score greater than 700. We can now submit this proof
to Teller to validate an unsecured loan request.

## FAQ

- I'm getting `Login unsuccessful. Please check your credentials or restart the application and try again`, what does this mean?

Usually this means that the credit karma credentials were not correct and the application could not sign into credit karma. Check your credentials and try again.

If your credentials are correct and you are still getting this error message, it is likely that the Mina application is having trouble opening up an instance of Credit Karma. If this is the case, try closing the application and removing any running processes of the Mina app.

- Credit score is less than 700, cannot produce SNAPP proof to: /home/.../snapp-credit-score

This means that the users credit score was below the 700 threshold range and so a proof will not be generated.

- I'm getting `Failed to generate proof to: /.../snapp-credit-score`, what does this mean?

This error indicates that Mina app failed to generate a SNARK proof.
If this error occurs, please file an [issue](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues) on our Github with a title including `SNAPP Credit App` and your operating system information.
