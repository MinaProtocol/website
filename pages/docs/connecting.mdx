# Connect to the Network

In this section, we'll connect to the `Mainnet` network and send our first transaction. Let's first start up the node so that we can begin issuing commands.

## Update your software

The first step in connecting to `Mainnet` is installing the latest daemon version. Follow the instructions for your operating system below.

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

First remove any previously installed version of the daemon to prevent any errors when upgrading to the latest version. Then you can install the latest version as follows:

```
sudo apt-get remove -y mina-testnet-postake-medium-curves
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net release main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-mainnet=1.1.4-a8893ab
```

Check that daemon installed correctly by running `mina version`. The output should read `Commit a8893ab6dd8a68171e7b99a5dc6b76940411350b on branch master`.

## Start up a node

Since this technology is still relatively new, there are a few rare situations where your node can run into some issues. We don't want for your nodes to break and you not realize! So we've made some officially supported auto-restart flows for you. We'll be iterating on these in future releases.

However, first we'll want to make sure everything works by running it manually before starting with the auto-restart flows.

Note: If you are using the Hetzner hosting provider, we are currently experiencing an issue where Hetzner believes our software is being malicious. See the [Networking section of the troubleshooting page](/docs/troubleshooting#networking) to learn how to mitigate this before starting a node.

Run the following command to start up a Mina node instance and connect to the live network:

```
mina daemon --generate-genesis-proof true --peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt
```

If you have a key with stake and would like to produce blocks, also provide `--block-producer-key ~/keys/my-wallet`, replacing `~/keys/my-wallet` with the path to your private key if not the default.

The `-peer-list` argument specified above refer to the seed peer address - this is the initial peer we will connect to on the network. Since Mina is a [peer-to-peer](/docs/glossary#peer-to-peer) protocol, there is no single centralized server we rely on.

See [here](/docs/troubleshooting) for common issues when first running a node.

You're not done yet! Now that you've confirmed things are okay by running the standalone process, it is important we start Mina in a manner that will auto-restart itself when it dies.

First kill the existing `mina daemon` process with `Ctrl-C`, and then keep reading:

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

Ensure your private-key that you've registered with is located at `~/keys/my-wallet`.

Add a file `~/.mina-env` containing the following:

```
CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS="private key password"
EXTRA_FLAGS=" --file-log-level Debug"
```

You can add extra flags later to `EXTRA_FLAGS` as you see fit.

Mina will be looking for its peers in a file called `~/peers.txt`, so run the following command to create it:

```
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt > ~/peers.txt
```

Then run the following commands to start up a Mina node instance and connect to the live network:

```
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start mina
systemctl --user enable mina
sudo loginctl enable-linger
```

These commands will allow the node to continue running after you logout, and restart automatically when the machine reboots.

By default, the node connects to the network using the default external-port of 8302. This can be changed using the `-external-port` flag, just add that to EXTRA_FLAGS.

You can also look into the mina process itself that's running in the background and auto-restarting.

This command will let you know if `mina` had any trouble getting started.

```
systemctl --user status mina
```

You can stop mina gracefully, and stop automatically-restarting the service:

```
systemctl --user stop mina
```

Manually Restart it:

```
systemctl --user restart mina
```

And look at logs:

```
journalctl --user -u mina -n 1000 -f
```

In some cases in order to view logs you need to run the following command instead:

```
journalctl --user-unit mina -n 1000 -f
```

That command will show you the last 1000 lines and follow from there.

### Docker

When running your daemon using Docker, first ensure that your private key has the correct permissions.

```
cd ~
chmod 700 ~/keys
chmod 600 ~/keys/my-wallet
mkdir ~/.mina-config
```

Now simply run the image with your keys and ~/.mina-config mounted:

```
docker run --name mina -d \
-p 8302:8302 \
--restart=always \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/keys,dst=/keys,readonly" \
--mount "type=bind,source=`pwd`/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config" \
-e CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS="YOUR PASSWORD HERE" \
minaprotocol/mina-daemon-baked:1.1.4-a8893ab \
daemon \
--block-producer-key /keys/my-wallet \
--insecure-rest-server \
--file-log-level Debug \
--log-level Info \
--peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt
```

Run `docker logs -f mina` to follow the logs, and if it crashes save the log output to a file with `docker logs mina > mina-log.txt` and post the output to the #mentor-nodes channel or attach the full ~/.mina-config/mina.log to a github issue and link the issue in discord.

Run `docker exec -it mina mina client status` to monitor connectivity to the network, you should quickly find at least 10 peers and watch the block height / max observed block height climb.

## Checking connectivity

Now that we've started up a node and are running the Mina daemon, open up another shell and run the following command:

    mina client status

<Alert>

It may take up to a minute before `mina client status` connects to the daemon when first starting up. So if you see `Error: daemon not running. See mina daemon`, just a wait a bit and try again.

If you are using the [Sandbox Node](/docs/developers/sandbox-node), due to a quirk in the way we communicate for the mina client status command, you will need to run `mina client status` inside the container itself:

`docker exec -it mina bash`

</Alert>

Most likely we will see a response that include the fields below:

    ...
    Peers:                                         Total: 4 (...)
    ...
    Sync Status:                                   Bootstrap

If you see `Sync Status: Bootstrap`, this means that the node is bootstrapping and needs to sync with the rest of the network. You may need to be patient here as this step might take some time for the node to get all the data it needs.

After a while, your node should connect to more peers and then should move into `Sync Status: Catchup`, which means we're gathering the most recent blocks and state trying to catch up the the highest block.

When sync status reaches `Synced` and the node is connected to 1 or more peers, we will have successfully connected to the network. We will also see a corresponding daemon log once we've synced: `[Info] Mina daemon is now synced`.

If you the `Bootstrap` state persists for more than an hour, there may be an issue with your port configuration.

## Import your account

Once our node is synced, we'll need to import our public/private keypair so that we can sign transactions and generate an address to receive payments. For security reasons, we'll want to put the keys under a directory that is harder for attackers to access.

Run the following command to import your [previously generated](/docs/keypair) keypair file:

    mina accounts import -privkey-path ~/keys/my-wallet

You will be prompted for the password you entered when the account was created.

<Alert kind="warning">

The public key can be shared freely with anyone, but be very careful with your private key file. Never share this private key with anyone, as it is the equivalent of a password for your funds.

</Alert>

The response from this command will look like this:

    ðŸ˜„ Imported account!
    Public key: B62qjaA4N9843FKM5FZk1HmeuDiojG42cbCDyZeUDQVjycULte9PFkC

Additionally you can use the `mina accounts create` command to generate new accounts to send and recieve transactions.

Since the public key is quite long and difficult to remember, let's save it as an environment variable. Use the following command but replace `<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>` with the public key output from the previous command:

    export MINA_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>

Now we can access this everywhere as `$MINA_PUBLIC_KEY` -- check if it saved properly by trying `echo $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY`.

Note that these environment variables will only be saved for the current shell session, so if you want to save them for future use, you can add them to `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`.

<Alert>

If you are running the node on a cloud virtual machine, make sure to export and save the key file. You can export the key with:

    mina accounts export -public-key <PUBLIC-KEY> -privkey-path <EXPORT-PATH>

Then save it to your local machine, maybe using [scp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp):

    scp <EXPORT-PATH> <LOCAL-DESTINATION>

Later, when starting up a new VM, you can upload the key and then import it:

    mina accounts import -privkey-path <PRIVATE-KEY-FILE>

</Alert>

If you ever forget what keypairs you've already created, you can see them all with:

    mina accounts list

## Check account balance

It may take a few minutes for your funds to appear. We can check the balance of all our accounts using this command:

    mina accounts list

You might see `Balance: 0 mina` for your account. Depending on the traffic in the network, it may take a few blocks before your transaction goes through.

<em>Tip</em>: You can run `mina client status` to see the current block height
updating.

## Make a payment

Finally we get to the good stuff, sending our first transaction! Before you send a payment, you'll need to unlock your account:

    mina accounts unlock -public-key $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY

For testing purposes, you should create a seperate account that you can send a transaction to. For this example we will use the following example public key as the recipient:

```
B62qndJi5mnRoBZ8SAYDM1oR2SgAk5WpZC8hGpJUZ4e64kDHGbFMeLJ
```

<Alert kind="warning">

If the recieving account has not recieved any transactions, there will be an additional Account Creation Fee of `1 MINA` that will be deducted from the transaction amount.

</Alert>

Let's send some of our newly received mina to this service to see what a payment looks like:

    mina client send-payment \
      -amount 1.5 \
      -receiver B62qndJi5mnRoBZ8SAYDM1oR2SgAk5WpZC8hGpJUZ4e64kDHGbFMeLJ \
      -fee 0.1 \
      -sender $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY

If you're wondering what we passed in to the commands above:

- For `amount`, we're sending a test value of `1.5` mina which is enough to cover the Account Creation Fee
- The `receiver` is the public key of the example account
- For `fee`, let's use 0.1 mina
- The `sender` is the full public key, eg. `B62qjaA4N9843FKM5FZk...`

If this command is formatted properly, we should get a response that looks like the following:

    Dispatched payment with ID 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

You may not see the `Receipt chain hash` on the first transaction from the account, but in following transactions, this will show you the head of the receipt chain hash list.

Once you feel comfortable with the basics of creating an address, and sending & receiving mina, we can move on to the truly unique parts of the Mina network - [participating in consensus and helping compress the blockchain](/docs/node-operator).

## Stepping up your game

Now that we have a fully synced node, we can learn about some of the more advanced features of the daemon in [Staking & Delegating](/docs/staking). And if you want to earn more tokens, check out the [Foundation Delegation Program](/docs/advanced/foundation-delegation-program).
